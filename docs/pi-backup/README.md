### Require a Password For Sudo

Default pi user is in the sudo group, That group is configured with passwordless sudo

1. You can confirm this with:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd
#Youâ€™ll probably see: jakobe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

2. Disable no password

```bash
sudo su
echo "jakobe ALL=(ALL) ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd
```

2. Test the config

```bash
^D
sudo -k
sudo ls
```
